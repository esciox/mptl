# My Personal Todo List 
Yes, yet another todo list application. I made it only because at work needed something quick'n dirty.
There's plenty of full featured applications, you can have fine control on your tasks and your productivity, but honestly I found poor focus in usability in my case. I need to write my requests quick, somewhere; I can put them later in a category, schedule and reorganize them on a calendar in another time. And I need to do this quick. That's the idea above this software.  

Just create a bunch of containers if you like, and add some tasks.  
Only task title is required.  
New tasks are created in the default container.  
You can drag and drop then in another container, or into a calendar day.  
You can edit, delete, or mark tasks as "done".  
That's all.
